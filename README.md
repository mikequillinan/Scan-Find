Scan & Find
==============

Scan & Find - Sample project with ZXing scanner doing lookups against various web sources.

Purpose
==============
This is a quick project that I'll be using to test and demonstrate the latest techniques in iOS and Objective-C development. Some techniques planned to be included are Storyboards, Grand Central Dispatch, Collection Literals and non-synthesized properties. Maybe some collection views later on.

Platform Support
==============
This project since its purpose is to test and demonstrate the latest techniques in iOS and Objective-C development will only be tested on the latest versions on Xcode and the latest full iOS version. Currently Xcode 4.5 and iOS 5.1-6 are the supported platforms. iPhone 5 support is included as well.

Setup
==============
Download the code from github. ZXing is included as a git submodule, so be sure to initialize it. Otherwise, you can download the forked copy here. Be sure to place it in the project's root under Submodules/zxing. If you put it somewhere else, just update the target's Header search paths for ZXingWidget's Classes folder and the cpp/core/src paths to point to your new path.

JSONKit is another submodule included. Be sure to initialize it.

ARC
==============
The main project is ARC compliant. ZXing 2.0 is being used for scanning and has not been updated to support ARC. This might be a cool thing to work on at some point.

Todo List
==============
- Make some use of the Storyboard. I still prefer old school xibs, although for a small project like this storyboards might be worth it.
- Review the conversions of my old boiler plate classes like WebViewController for ARC and modern Objective-C usage.
- Add the StoreLookup VC after conversion.
- Add Facebook/Twitter sharing of scanned items. Tell the world what you want! or something like that :-)
